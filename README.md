## User Research on Weather.gov 
### Main Design Challenge 
* _What is the main activity your project would support for users?_
  * The main activity that weather.gov supports for its users is to find the weather for a specific location and to find other important information surrounding the weather in an area. Are there important alerts happening: rainstorms, fire, or other natural phenomenons?
* _What is the basic need involved for that activity?_
  * This activity solves the users’ basic need for safety. Without knowing the right precautions needed to take for the day to protect against the elements, the user can be put in harms way, such as needing sunscreen on a sunny day or a raincoat for when it rains.
* _What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?_
  * The first most traditional way to check the weather is to simply go outside and see what the temperature feels like, e.g., warm, cold, windy. Another source of weather information is the news. Morning news shows have weather segments that give a daily and sometimes weekly forecast for general areas that your news provider services. Smartphones, now, have weather apps that give a daily breakdown and a weekly forecast. Some apps come with a few advanced features such as chance of rain and humidity and can be tailored to your specific location. All of these have limitations, however, and weather.gov can provide all of this information and more.
* _What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?_
  * The first two examples (walking outside and the news) are limited in their accuracy. Walking outside will only give you the current weather; the weather may change drastically throughout the day and a person may not know that from just one instance in the say. The news weather is also not specific. It often times gives weather for a larger area, it is not highly localized to your address. Digital technology allows users to see a weather forecast for their specific location, they can input their zip code, and it can provide more information such as hourly updates and precipitation chances.

### Users 
* _Demographics_
  * People who have access to the internet. Adults to teens. Those who dress themselves or dress others I.e., children who do not dress themselves or have access to the internet.
* _Preferences_
  * Users are interested in specific and detailed weather forecasts.
* _Expertise_
  * Basic levels of expertise: search for location and understand temperatures.
* _Where would users do this activity?_
  * Users would most likely do this at their home computer in the morning while getting prepared for the day. Or at another location where users can access computers in advance for the next day (work, library). 
* _What would the users do to complete the activity?_
  * The user will navigate throughout the website, searching for their current location and see if they can find the helpful information from that page that they want, such as an hourly breakdown. For more advanced searches they will navigate to other areas of the website, such as “safety” and search for more detailed information such as UV index. 

### Research 
* _Method_
  * I used participatory observation research to conduct this activity. My mom volunteered, as the only person available to me, who also fits the demographics my website aims at.
* _Script_
  * The script that I followed during my avtivity can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vDMXNtb1-SK_44kGPuCjVESx0p6GlOQ87Unp5JplFbw/edit).  
* _Activity File_
  * The audio recording of my participant during the activity can be found [here](). 
* _Transcript_
  * The transcript of my audio recording can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bjNb7zqZGqVgDXgPbhfYaf7b_lTqP2ZIM1MG0GwkK5M/edit). 
  
### Reflection
* I learned a lot doing this activity. Planning the interview was easier than I thought because we had examples to follow and then while I did the interview it was really nice having a script to use because it meant that I would stumble less over my words. Having a script also made it easier to expand on my ideas with the participant because I had a basic outline already. It was good to get more feedback about the website and its usability by a user who might actually want to use the site.
* \* I was very confused dong this activity, it was not clear to me what we were supposed to have our person do, so I am not quite confident that I asked the right questions or had the participant do the correct activity on the website.
