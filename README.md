## User Research on Weather.gov 
### Main Design Challenge 
* What is the main activity your project would support for users?
  * The main activity that weather.gov supports for its users is to find the weather for a specific location and to find other important information surrounding the weather in an area. Are there important alerts happening: rainstorms, fire, or other natural phenomenons?
* What is the basic need involved for that activity?
