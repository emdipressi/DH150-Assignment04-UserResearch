## User Research on Weather.gov 
### Main Design Challenge 
* What is the main activity your project would support for users?
  * The main activity that weather.gov supports for its users is to find the weather for a specific location and to find other important information surrounding the weather in an area. Are there important alerts happening: rainstorms, fire, or other natural phenomenons?
* What is the basic need involved for that activity?
 * This activity solves the usersâ€™ basic need for safety. Without knowing the right precautions needed to take for the day to protect against the elements, the user can be put in harms way, such as needing sunscreen on a sunny day or a raincoat for when it rains.
* What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
 * The first most traditional way to check the weather is to simply go outside and see what the temperature feels like, e.g., warm, cold, windy. Another source of weather information is the news. Morning news shows have weather segments that give a daily and sometimes weekly forecast for general areas that your news provider services. Smartphones, now, have weather apps that give a daily breakdown and a weekly forecast. Some apps come with a few advanced features such as chance of rain and humidity and can be tailored to your specific location. All of these have limitations, however, and weather.gov can provide all of this information and more.
* What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
 * The first two examples (walking outside and the news) are limited in their accuracy. Walking outside will only give you the current weather; the weather may change drastically throughout the day and a person may not know that from just one instance in the say. The news weather is also not specific. It often times gives weather for a larger area, it is not highly localized to your address. Digital technology allows users to see a weather forecast for their specific location, they can input their zip code, and it can provide more information such as hourly updates and precipitation chances.
